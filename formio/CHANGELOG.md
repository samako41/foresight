# Changelog

## 16.0.2.3

Fix the `formio.form` function `_get_public_form_js_locales` (wrong argument), called in the config route/endpoint.

Enable a portal and/or public Form to _redirect (page) to URL_ upon a _Save Draft is Done_.\
This can be set in new fields in the Form Builder:
- Portal Save-Draft Done URL
- Public Save-Draft Done URL

Enhance the public Form access-check, by allowing _custom_ implementation(s) configured by a new selection field `public_access_rule_type`,
with current choice `time_interval`\
Other `public_access_rule_type` choices with a inheritted `public_access` (method) check implementation can be implemented by modules and apps\
Updating this module also executes a migration, which ensures existing form builders set the `public_access_rule_type` field value to `time_interval`.

## 16.0.2.2

Fix formio.js version (action/button) _Download and install_ error:\
`ValueError: max() arg is an empty sequence`.\
Initialize the translations sequence properly.

## 16.0.2.1

Improvements for Version Translations (model: `formio.version.translation`):
- Compute and store origin (base translation, user added).
- Compute and show whether a copied (origin) base translation has been updated.
- Add sequence field. So translations can be ordered to ease admnistration and the translation override implementation.

Fix `name_get` method (models: `formio.translation`, `formio.version.translation`)

## 16.0.2.0

Major improvements for translations:
- Specific Version Translations instead of linking (Many2many) to the available Base Translations.
- Translations (overrides) of formio.js source properties in the form builder.

Add `noupdate=1` for the xmlid `formio.version_dummy` data (record).
This prevents recreation when the dummy version has been archived (is inactive).

- Set default and update the datetime (flatpickr) locale by language chooser in a form.

## 16.0.1.5

Improvements for administration of "Extra Assets" (js, css) with link/relation to attachments.\
Affected models: `formio.extra.asset`, `ir.attachment`.

## 16.0.1.4
